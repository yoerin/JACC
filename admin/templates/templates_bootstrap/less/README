COMPILING A TEMPLATE STYLE

change to this directory and call:

lessc styles/template-black.less > ../css/template-black.css
lessc --yui-compress  styles/template-black.less > ../css/template-black-min.css
lessc styles/responsive-black.less > ../css/responsive.css
lessc --yui-compress  styles/responsive-black.less > ../css/responsive-min.css

lessc responsive.less > ../css/responsive.css
lessc --yui-compress  responsive.less > ../css/responsive-min.css

CREATING YOUR OWN STYLE

% cp styles/template-black.less styles/template-myown.less
% cp cp styles/responsive-black.less styles/responsive-myown.less
% cp -R styles/black styles/myown
% nano styles/template-myown.less

replace the line '@import "black/allstart.less";' with '@import "myown/allstart.less";'

% nano styles/responsive-myown.less

Do the same replacement

Now go to styles/myown/, check all the less files in the folder, and define your own values.  It's recommended to start with allstart.less... 
  
After you may want to compile the less by replacing "black" in the first chapter with "myown" :.-)
